@W: MT529 :"d:\ivan\faks\1. semestar\diglog\1.lv\impl1\source\rf_modulator.vhd":233:4:233:5|Found inferred clock rf_modulator|clk_pll_inferred_clock which controls 116 sequential elements including I12.R_outw[31:2]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
