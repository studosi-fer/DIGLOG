Starting router resource preassignment
WARNING - par: The driver of primary clock net R_clk_divgen[23] is not placed on one of the PIO sites dedicated for primary clocks.  This primary clock will be routed to a H-spine through general routing resource or will be routed as a secondary clock and may suffer from excessive delay or skew.

*****************************************************************
Info: NBR allows conflicts(one node used by more than one signal)
      in the earlier iterations. In each iteration, it tries to  
      solve the conflicts while keeping the critical connections 
      routed as shorter as possible. The routing process is said 
      to be completed when no conflicts exist and all connections
      are routed.                                                
Note: NBR uses a different method to calculate timing slacks. The
      worst slack and total negative slack may not be the same as
      that in TRCE report. You should always run TRCE to verify  
      your design. Thanks.
